This is an implementation of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) deveoped by C++. Both supervised and unsupvised training methods are developed.

## Theroy Basic
HMM is a generative model $p_x$ 

## Supervised HMM
The supervised HMM is very intituive and we simply count the transition and emission.

## Unsupervised HMM
Both the hard EM and soft EM method are implemented.
